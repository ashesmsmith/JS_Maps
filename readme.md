# Overview

The JS Maps program uses multiple Google Maps APIs and JavaScript to create a Travel Itinerary from users inputs. The user will input the desired locations and the program will calculate the route which is displayed on a map. The user entered locations are also displayed as a list. The distance and duration are calculated and displayed.

This program was written for the purpose of creating a visual and custom Travel Itinerary with expected travel distance and duration.
